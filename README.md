## [[Open Challenges (to transform education)]]
Fundació Jaume Bofill

## Purpose
Mobilise and engage the broad education community (teachers, experts, policymakers, researchers, stakeholders,..) in a process of defining problems and solving challenges collaboratively as a way of driving change in the ed system. We want Open Challenge to be the main driver of our activity: whether it is to crowdsource information, solve problems, distribute difussion, etc.    

## Description 
We want to create a platform that supports all the open challenges we launch. We think of it as a modular platform, with tools and technologies that support all the process. 
The project is open because...
a. We run open challenges,with different objectives:
    1. crowdsourcing for needs, mapping of problems, generating data
    2. detection of leaderships
    3. co-creation of solutions
    4....
b.We want it to be an open learning experiènce. In as much as possible we would like to make all the process open to all: not only the solutions but also the processes, the work, the problems... of those involved in the challenges. Crucially, we want to make sure that the knowledge (solutions or other) are transferred to the rest of the system.

We already have some of the methologies and technologies: Design Thinking, Hackathons, Open Calls, EdCamps, EdXats, Webinars, VideoStreamings, DemoLabs,...
